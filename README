Automatically cache ActiveRecord associations in memcached.

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_cached
  belongs_to_cached :group
end

class Group < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_cached
end

Instead of caching the association objects and writing expiration sweepers,
we cache the association ids and load the objects from memcached by id.

cache_fu is required (for now)
